    <h3>What is the Africa CDC Africa PGI NGS Academy? </h3>
    <p>
      The <b>NGS Academy </b>for the Africa CDC's Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative is coordinated
      by the University of Cape Town's Computational Biology Division (CBIO) in collaboration with Africa CDC
      and
      ACEGID. The NGS Academy draws on the extensive expertise of ACEGID on pathogen surveillance training and the
      expertise of H3ABioNet, a pan African bioinformatics network, which runs a training and outreach program for
      genomics and bioinformatics.

    <p>Together with the Gates Foundation, the
      Africa CDC has developed a Pathogen Genomics Initiative to enable the roll out of next generation
      sequencing
      (NGS) for pathogen surveillance and response. Several nodes are being established across Africa under this
      initiative which will need to receive training on all aspects of NGS implementation.</p>
