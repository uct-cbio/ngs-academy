    <h3>Pathogen Genomics and Epidemiology Training Survey </h3>
    </p>
    <p>A landscaping exercise is being carried out to identify existing training courses and materials relevant to
      Pathogen Genomics and Epidemiology. Information about courses and training materials are being collated into
      a
      central resource that may be used in training the various role players in this area, most notably in the
      public
      health sector.
      The Survey can be accessed <a href="https://redcap.h3abionet.org/redcap/surveys/?s=FCA9MTKHPH">here</a>.
