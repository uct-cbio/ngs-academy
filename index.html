      The Africa CDC Pathogen Genomics Initiative NGS Academy aims to develop and deliver a comprehensive training
      framework for the implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS) for pathogen surveillance. This
      includes
      all
      aspects of NGS, from sample collection to sequencing and analysis to inform public health interventions.</p>

    <h3>Pathogen genomics and epidemiology training survey </h3>
    </p>
    <p>A landscaping exercise is being carried out to identify existing training courses and materials relevant to
      Pathogen Genomics and Epidemiology. Information about courses and training materials are being collated into
      a
      central resource that may be used in training the various role players in this area, most notably in the
      public
      health sector.
      The Survey can be accessed <a href="https://redcap.h3abionet.org/redcap/surveys/?s=FCA9MTKHPH">here</a>.
