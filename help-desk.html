    <p>We are excited to announce the launch of our helpdesk ticketing system which manages queries that are submitted to the NGS Academy to provide support for the Africa CDC Pathogen Genomics Initiative and others working in pathogen surveillance.
      For example, when course participants have follow up questions or issues, they can submit their questions via the helpdesk ticketing system. The system then creates a digital record of the query and notifies appropriately qualified Trainers to provide assistance. </p>
      Here's what you can expect from our help-desk ticketing system:
                        <br>  
      1. <b>Simplified Ticket Submission: </b>Submitting a ticket is via a one page form where one can also search for a ticket within the database     <br>
      2. <b>Enhanced Tracking:</b> Keep track of your submitted tickets from start to finish. You'll receive real-time updates via email on the status of your request/ticket, making it simple to stay informed about progress.     <br>
      3. <b>Faster Response Times:</b> Our new system allows our trainers to address your inquiries more efficiently. With categorization of tickets and routing, you can expect quicker responses and resolution.     <br>
      4. <b>Knowledge Base Access:</b> Access our comprehensive knowledge base directly from the submission form and ticket tags available on the track ticket tab. You might find instant answers to your questions without even needing to submit a ticket     <br>
      5.<b> Personal information:</b> Each ticket is allocated a ticket number, personal information such as email addresses of trainees are not displayed on tickets and trainee email addresses are only used to deliver ticket status updates.
