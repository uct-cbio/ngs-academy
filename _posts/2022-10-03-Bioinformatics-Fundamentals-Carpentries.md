course_overview :  This Bioinformatics Fundamentals virtual workshop will use the Carpentries team to provide training on Linux, Shell Scripts, and other foundational skills. The main focus for this virtual training is to introduce participants to the fundamental tools used to interact with the computer without a graphical user interface, some of which will allow users to perform more advanced tasks, such as automate repetitive tasks, and combine smaller tasks into larger, more complex workflows.

<p align="left"><b class="text-left">Objectives and expected outcomes:</b></p>

<p>The Carpentries virtual training workshop on Linux, Shell Scripts, fundamentals on bioinformatics is 3
hours a day for 3 days, designed to introduce the utilization of Unix/Command Line, which is fundamental
to a wide range of advanced computing tasks. The course will also provide an introduction to
high-performance computing. The training includes live Q&A sessions with experts over Zoom and group
discussions.
</p>

<p align="left"><b class="text-left">Course limitations:</b></p>

<p>The Carpentries virtual training will introduce participants to Unix/Command Line and GitHub, focusing on
a basic overview, functionality and features. This is not an advanced course, it will only teach basic skills
for research computing.
</p>



<p align="left"><b class="text-left">Intended audience:</b></p>

<p>Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in
less time. If you would like to learn the foundational skills to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code such as Unix/Command line. Then the course will empower you to learn new skills and build
confidence in using them in your work.
