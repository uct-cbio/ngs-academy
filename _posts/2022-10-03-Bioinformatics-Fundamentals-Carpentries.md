course_overview :  This Bioinformatics Fundamentals virtual workshop used the Carpentries team to provide training on Linux, Shell Scripts, and other foundational skills. The main focus for this virtual training was to introduce participants to the fundamental tools used to interact with the computer without a graphical user interface, some of which will allow users to perform more advanced tasks, such as automate repetitive tasks, and combine smaller tasks into larger, more complex workflows.

<p align="left"><b class="text-left">Objectives and expected outcomes:</b></p>

<p>The Carpentries virtual training workshop on Linux, Shell Scripts, fundamentals on bioinformatics was 3
hours a day for 3 days, designed to introduce the utilization of Unix/Command Line, which is fundamental
to a wide range of advanced computing tasks. The course provided an introduction to
high-performance computing. The training included live Q&A sessions with experts over Zoom and group
discussions.
</p>

<p align="left"><b class="text-left">Course limitations:</b></p>

<p>The Carpentries virtual training will introduced participants to Unix/Command Line and GitHub, focused on
a basic overview, functionality and features. This is was not an advanced course, it only taught basic skills
for research computing.
</p>



<p align="left"><b class="text-left">Intended audience:</b></p>

<p>Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in
less time. Participants who would like to learn the foundational skills to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code such as Unix/Command line. Then the course will empowers one to learn new skills and build
confidence in using them in your work.
