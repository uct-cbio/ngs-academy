<!-- ### SARS-CoV-2 NGS bioinformatics course 2021 -->

<p align="left"><b >Course overview:</b></p>

<p>The conference will build new partnerships that harness our understanding of the disease mechanisms, accelerating the pace of effective treatments for mitochondrial diseases. This yearâ€™s programme will include discussions about recent discoveries on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders to develop new therapeutic targets and the latest advances in gene editing and genomic technologies. We will also have panel discussions on how we rally the international community for clinical trial consortia and current opportunities and challenges in clinical trials.
<br>
The meeting attracts international participants interested in mitochondrial diseases, working in genomics, biochemistry, pathology and clinical medicine. The conference will bring together leaders in translational mitochondrial medicine and basic science with a programme designed to engage and inspire the next generation of mitochondrial researchers.
<br>
The programme will also feature short oral presentations selected from abstracts, posters, poster pitches and networking opportunities. Participants choosing accommodation will stay at Hinxton Hall Conference Centre, Wellcome Genome Campus, to enhance opportunities for interaction after the sessions.</p>
