course_overview : The aim of this program is to provide virtual training for personnel at African institutions involved in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for surveillance. It is primarily aimed at staff who will be preparing samples, doing the sequencing, and running basic data analysis. The content has been divided into modules, some of which are independent, while others form recommended prerequisites for the next module. The content provides theoretical knowledge on the steps required for the workflow from sample selection to analysis, to prepare participants for more practical laboratory training when this is feasible. Virtual sessions generally include videos or live online presentations followed by live Q&A sessions with trainers. Where relevant, participants complete practical exercises and submit assignments.
