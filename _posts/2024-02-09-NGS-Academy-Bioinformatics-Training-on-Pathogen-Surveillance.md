course_overview : The aim of this program is to provide virtual training for personnel at African institutions involved in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for surveillance. It is primarily aimed at staff who will be preparing samples, doing the sequencing, and running basic data analysis. The content has been divided into modules, some of which are independent, while others form recommended prerequisites for the next module. The content provides theoretical knowledge on the steps required for the workflow from sample selection to analysis, to prepare participants for more practical laboratory training when this is feasible. Virtual sessions generally include videos or live online presentations followed by live Q&A sessions with trainers. Where relevant, participants complete practical exercises and submit assignments

 <b>Purpose of the course:</b>

 <ul>
  <li>1. Develop fundamental bioinformatics skills. Increasing programming knowledge, developing additional computational skills to allow more capacity building across the  Africa continent</li>
  <li>2. Introduce different bioinformatic workflows for specific pathogens surveillance.</li>
  <li>3. Examples on Galaxy, coding in R.</li>
    <li>4. Use cases of "intermediate bioinformatics": cholera outbreak (which is analysed by mapping reads to reference and is essentially  treated as a clonal organism in an outbreak situation) </li>
  <li>5. Use case we look at the web tools, but focus on the command line with the Bactopia workflow (which is a well maintained nf-core compliant Nextflow workflow) and visualisation using Microreact and Grapetree.</li>
 
</ul>
