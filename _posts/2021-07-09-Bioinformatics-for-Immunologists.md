### Bioinformatics for Immunologists (Virtual) 27 September- 01 October 2021

[ Bioinformatics for Immunologists (Virtual)](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/bioinformatics-for-immunologists-virtual-20210927/?utm_source=dotdigital&utm_medium=Email_Virtual&utm_campaign=BioinformaticsImmuno21&utm_content=organic_email)

This course – organised in association with EMBL-EBI – will provide participants with an introduction to a range of bioinformatics resources and approaches applicable to immunological research. The resources introduced during the course will cover a variety of data types, from genomic and proteomic data to computational models, biological pathways, and reaction information.

Participants will gain experience of the analysis pipelines for NGS experiments relevant to immunology and will be led through an exploration of this data to identify information of interest. They will also learn how data from several sources can be integrated to provide a wider view of their research, thereby enabling them to be more confident users of their own data and that from public sources.

The course is aimed at individuals working in immunology research who have minimal experience in bioinformatics. Applicants are expected to be at an early stage of using bioinformatics in their research with the need to develop their skills and knowledge further. Participants will need a basic knowledge of the Unix command line, and the R statistical package. We recommend these free tutorials:

    Introduction to the Unix environment – http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
    Basic R concepts – http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction
