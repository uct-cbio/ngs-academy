course_overview : The Carpentries virtual training workshop is a pre-course to our bioinformatics NGS course. The main focus for this virtual training is to introduce some powerful tools that will allow users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. This will all help users automate repetitive tasks, and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

<b>Objectives and expected outcomes:</b> 

<ol>
<li>The Carpentries virtual training workshop is 3 hours a day for 3 days, designed with the utilization of
Unix/Command lines, which are fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including
many of the high-performance computing. The lessons covered will introduce the participants to some
powerful new tools and upskill themselves in the more advanced computational area of Bioinformatics.
The training includes live Q&A sessions with experts over Zoom, group discussions.</li>
