summary: High throughput sequencing has gained widespread adoption as an essential experimental assay for biological research. Analysing high throughput sequencing data involves an array of different bioinformatics tools and techniques. Therefore, it is important for experimental scientists to have the bioinformatics skills required to effectively assess and analyse data produced by next generation sequencing.This course aims to provide a hands-on introduction to bioinformatics for next generation sequencing and to equip participants with the essential informatics skills and knowledge required to begin analysing next generation sequencing data and carry out some of the most common types of analysis.
