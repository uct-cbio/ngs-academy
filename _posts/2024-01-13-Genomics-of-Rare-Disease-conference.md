<!-- ### SARS-CoV-2 NGS bioinformatics course 2021 -->

<p align="left"><b >Course overview:</b></p>

<p>Our 18th conference on rare disease will combine recent research on genetic mechanisms involved in disease, with advances in approaches for clinical care.
<br>
This year’s conference will include discussion on the use of a ‘pangenome’ to improve diagnostic yield, the role of common variants in rare disease, and new developments in prenatal and neonatal genomic screening.
<br>
The programme will include podium presentations selected from abstracts submitted on the broad themes of the conference. Posters and poster-pitch talks will provide opportunities to present research findings or get feedback on ongoing projects.
<br>
This highly-interactive meeting fosters knowledge exchange among clinicians, clinical scientists, researchers and bioinformaticians working on rare diseases. There will be plenty of opportunities to establish collaborations through face-to-face networking with inclusive meals, and optional on-site accommodation.</p>
