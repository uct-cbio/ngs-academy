### Genetic Analysis of Population-based Association Studies (Virtual) 20-24 September 2021

[ Genetic Analysis of Population-based Association Studies (Virtual)](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/genetic-analysis-of-population-based-association-studies-virtual-20210920/?utm_source=dotdigital&utm_medium=Email_Virtual&utm_campaign=AssociationStudies21&utm_content=organic_email)

This advanced course aims to give researchers involved in genetic disease studies a firm grounding in the use of the latest statistical methods and software for analysis of genetic association studies.This includes both small-scale disease-specific studies and large-scale collaborative projects including those that can be used for analysis of multiple complex traits such as UK Biobank.

The course will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of the design and analysis of such studies. Each topic will include a lecture followed by a practical session in which state-of-the-art statistical software will be applied to relevant datasets. 

The practical sessions will illustrate the ideas presented in the lectures. All the software used will be freely available so that skills learned can be applied after the course.The programme will also include seminars from internationally renowned researchers from the field of complex disease genetics, along with opportunities for participants to discuss their own research projects with course instructors and with each other.
