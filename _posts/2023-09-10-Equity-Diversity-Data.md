<!-- ### SARS-CoV-2 NGS bioinformatics course 2021 -->

<p align="left"><b >Course overview:</b></p>

<p>Genomics has advanced significantly since the first human genome was published – with millions of genomes sequenced and genotyped in research and diagnostic settings. However, many genetic and genomic studies continue to include data mostly from populations of Europe and of European ancestry. Therefore the benefits of genomic research – a better understanding of disease, early detection and diagnosis, drug design and improved healthcare – can exclude groups not represented in this data, exacerbating existing health disparities.</p>

<p>This workshop will explore the causes and impact of under-representation in genomics, the factors that affect equity and diversity in genomics, and discuss how we can build equitable and trustworthy practices in genomic research, data collection and usage. The workshop will feature case studies and contributions from organisations that are conducting large-scale studies into population health to explore and discuss best practice.</p>
