<p>In collaboration with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), South Africa, we are pleased to announce the Antimicrobial Resistance of Bacterial Pathogens course.
<br>
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health emergency, and threatens the safe delivery of modern medical care. A recent study estimated that there were 4.95 million deaths associated with AMR bacterial infections in 2019 with the majority of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (Murray et al, 2022). Global projections of the negative impact of AMR predict the loss of nearly 10 million lives per year, and a cumulative loss of global production up to 100 trillion US dollars by 2050. AMR requires immediate, concerted, international, collaborative action to monitor its prevalence and spread throughout the world. The importance of this has been recognised both by the United Nations, and by the World Health Organisation; the latter has published a list of priority pathogens and a global strategy for AMR surveillance.
<br>
The challenges of controlling AMR in Africa are considerable for a number of reasons, including overuse and misuse of antibiotics,  lack of antimicrobial policies or stewardship programmes, limitations in data infrastructure and information sharing on antimicrobial prescription, consumption.  Workforce capacity challenges and resources are major factors impacting on quality of data and subsequent care. In addition, there is limited knowledge of pathogen strains  and AMR gene carriage due to lack of consistent and comprehensive AMR surveillance, making it difficult to track transmission, evaluate risks, detect and control outbreaks in hospitals and communities. To develop capacity for effective control of AMR, multi-disciplinary approaches are needed. Technologies such as whole genome sequencing, bioinformatics and data science tools are revolutionising routine diagnostics and surveillance of disease causing pathogens.  
<br>
The aim of this course is to improve skills for effective AMR detection and develop capacity for genomic surveillance of AMR.  It will provide a basic introduction and practical training in the laboratory aspects of AMR detection (phenotypic and molecular testing) in bacteria. The course will integrate theoretical aspects on the evolution and spread of AMR and explore the use of whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis and methods for AMR surveillance and control. </p>
