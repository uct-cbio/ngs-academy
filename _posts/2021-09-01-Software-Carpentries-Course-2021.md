course_overview : The Carpentries virtual training workshop is a pre-course to our bioinformatics NGS course. The main focus for this virtual training is to introduce some powerful tools that will allow users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. This will all help users automate repetitive tasks, and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

</ol>

<b>Course limitations:</b> 

<ol>
<li>The Carpentries virtual training will introduce participants to Unix/Command Line and GitHub, focusing on a basic overview, functionality and features. This is not an advanced course, it will only teach basic skills for research computing.</li>

</ol>

<b>Intended audience:</b> 

<ol>
<li>
Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time. If you would like to learn the foundational skills to work effectively and reproducibly with data and code such as Unix/Command line. Then the course will empower you to learn new skills and build confidence in using them in your work.</li>
